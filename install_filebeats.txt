# Download the ARM-specific Filebeat package
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-8.x.x-arm.deb
# Install the package
sudo apt -i filebeat-8.x.x-arm.deb

# configure Filebeat with your ELK cluster


# run filebeat

# Check the configuration file for errors
sudo filebeat test config
# Test the connection to Elasticsearch
sudo filebeat test output
# Run Filebeat in the foreground to see logs and errors in real-time
sudo filebeat -e

### Step 4: Enable Filebeat as a System Service

For production use, you'll want to run Filebeat as a background service so it starts automatically on boot.

```bash
# Enable the Filebeat service
sudo systemctl enable filebeat
# Start the Filebeat service
sudo systemctl start filebeat

With these steps, your Raspberry Pi will be successfully configured as a log shipper, sending all the defined logs to your central Elasticsearch cluster for analysis and visualization.
